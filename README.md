# Omar

An umbrella application built to grow organically.

## Goals

 - Encourage pragmatic code organisation
 - Code that will change together should be nearby
 - It should be easy to test individual features and subsystems
 - Avoid unnecessary resource usage (DB Connection pools, http server processes)
 - Enable distillery releases for different combinations of apps
